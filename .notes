Introduction
============

The target audience is plugin developers.
Plugin developers create plugins for the engine to execute.

Plugins are :
- Repositories
- Steps
- e.t.c

Consider carefully what plugin developers should be allowed to 'see'.
Less is better.

- Use test implementations and mocks for unit testing
- Host plugins in nuget
- Enforce a naming convention e.g. (uniformity, easy to find in nuget or github)
